## What to do next (in order)

1. **Disable compression for images** (Traefik/nginx, as above).
2. **Add long-lived Cache-Control** for fingerprinted static files.
3. **Enable HTTP/3** at the edge (Traefik with UDP:443, or CDN).
4. **Verify** in DevTools: TTFB down, `content-encoding` gone on images, `Cache-Control` present, optional `Alt-Svc` visible.
5. If needed, front it with a **CDN** and cache `/assets/*` or `/images/*`.

If you share how your images are hosted (nginx container, S3/R2, or served by Astro) and whether Traefik or a CDN terminates TLS, I can drop in exact config blocks for your stack.










Short answer: the missing `alt-svc` isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs making your images slow. üôÇ
`Alt-Svc: h3=":443"` only tells the browser ‚Äúhey, this host also speaks HTTP/3.‚Äù It helps future requests (and sometimes parallel ones) but it doesn‚Äôt turn a slow transfer into a fast one. Your headers reveal a much bigger culprit:

* `content-encoding: zstd` on **image/webp** ‚Äî that‚Äôs recompressing already-compressed images. It wastes CPU, blocks streaming, and can slow or even break intermediary caching.

Below is a focused checklist to make image delivery snappy on your Astro site behind Coolify/Traefik (and your nginx image origin).

---

# Fix the real bottlenecks

## 1) Don‚Äôt compress images again

**Disable zstd/gzip for images** at whichever layer is doing it.

### If Traefik adds compression (middleware `compress`)

Dynamic config (file or labels):

```toml
# traefik dynamic (file)
[http.middlewares.noimgcompress.compress]
  excludedContentTypes = [
    "image/*", "video/*", "audio/*",
    "font/*", "application/zip", "application/pdf"
  ]
```

Attach this middleware to the router that serves images (or disable compression entirely there).

### If nginx is the image server

In your nginx site:

```nginx
# turn off recompression for already compressed types
gzip off;                 # or at least don't list images in gzip_types
zstd off;                 # if the zstd module is enabled

# (If you must keep compression globally, then do:)
# gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript application/json application/xml;
# zstd_types text/plain text/css application/javascript application/json application/xml;

# Match images explicitly to be safe
location ~* \.(webp|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|avif)$ {
    gzip off;
    zstd off;
}
```

Why: recompressing WebP/AVIF brings negligible size gains and adds latency; some caches won‚Äôt store responses with `Content-Encoding` they don‚Äôt normalize.

---

## 2) Send strong caching headers

Your responses have `ETag`/`Last-Modified` but **no `Cache-Control`**. Browsers will revalidate and you‚Äôll pay extra round-trips.

For fingerprinted assets (Astro emits hashed filenames), add:

```nginx
location ~* \.(webp|avif|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|ico|js|css|woff2)$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
}
```

(or the equivalent Traefik Headers middleware).

---

## 3) Make HTTP/3 (Alt-Svc) work properly (optional boost)

It‚Äôs nice to have, but it‚Äôs not the main issue. If you want consistent `alt-svc`:

### With Traefik (Coolify default)

* Use Traefik v3+ and enable HTTP/3 on the **websecure** entrypoint.
* Expose **UDP 443** on the host (and in your cloud firewall).
* Traefik will emit `Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=...` automatically.

Static config example:

```toml
# traefik static (traefik.yml/traefik.toml)
[entryPoints.websecure]
  address = ":443"
  [entryPoints.websecure.http3]  # enables h3 & Alt-Svc
```

Docker labels on the Traefik container (host mode/ports):

```yaml
ports:
  - "443:443/tcp"
  - "443:443/udp"   # IMPORTANT for QUIC
```

### If Cloudflare/CDN fronts you

* Turn on ‚ÄúHTTP/3 (with QUIC)‚Äù.
* Open UDP/443 upstream if you terminate TLS at your edge.
* You‚Äôll either get `Alt-Svc` from the CDN or H3 via DNS (SVCB/HTTPS).

It‚Äôs normal that some responses show `Alt-Svc` and others don‚Äôt, depending on which hop terminates TLS or adds headers. Consistency comes from enabling H3 at the edge that actually faces the browser.

---

## 4) Confirm `Content-Length` and avoid chunking for static files

Static image responses should include `Content-Length`. If your server streams/chunks while recompressing, TTFB and total time go up. Disabling recompression (step 1) typically fixes this.

---

## 5) Use Astro‚Äôs image tooling correctly

* Use `@astrojs/image` (or the built-in `<Image />`) with `srcset`/`sizes` so you‚Äôre not shipping oversized images.
* Prefer AVIF/WebP, but still **don‚Äôt** add transport compression to them.
* Preload your **LCP** image (`<link rel="preload" as="image" ...>`) if it‚Äôs above the fold.

---

## 6) Put a CDN in front of images

Even a simple Cloudflare ‚ÄúCache Everything‚Äù (on an `/images/*` route) with long TTLs will:

* serve from edge (often over H3),
* normalize encodings,
* and hide your origin latency.

Be sure to **respect origin `Cache-Control`** so purging is predictable.

---

# Quick ‚Äúgood‚Äù vs ‚Äúbad‚Äù headers

‚úÖ Good for static, hashed images

```
HTTP/2 200
content-type: image/webp
content-length: 123456
cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
etag: "68ba26c5-2a995c"
last-modified: Thu, 04 Sep 2025 23:54:45 GMT
accept-ranges: bytes
alt-svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000    # optional, but nice
```

üö´ Avoid

```
content-encoding: zstd            # on images ‚Äî remove it
(no Cache-Control)                # add it
(Chunked transfer for local static files)  # often a side-effect of recompression
```
